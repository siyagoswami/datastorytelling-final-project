        <p>Just half of the average life of these two hypothetical residents are so vastly different. 
            It is dificult to erase or even change centuries of history and inequality. 
            We cannot exactly flick a switch or snap our fingers to make Essex County a safer, 
            more secure place to live. We cannot erase the years of systemic inequality that have given 
            Hunterdon County residents more protection and stability during disruptive times. 
        <br/><br/>
        However, the future is already upon us, and the time to act is now. Although 
        9 million people, myself included, may not be able to change the fact that New Jersey is our home, 
        we certainly <strong>can</strong> build a better home for us, and the people that 
        come after us. 
        <br/><br/>
        Luckily, Essex County residents are already relentlessly working to rebuild 
        the narratives of so many Black individuals and families by turning social 
        vulnerability into community power.
